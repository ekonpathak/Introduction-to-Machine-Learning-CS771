##Air Pollutant Prediction using Sensor Data‑
Built linear regression model to predict 03 and NO2 using just voltage, achieving 03
MAE 5.63 and NO2 MAE 6.3
• Built various non‑linear model By incorporating temperature, humidity, and timestamps along with voltage features.
• KNN was found best among them, achieving MAE 03 3.115 and NO2 MAE 1.83
## Entropy‑Driven Decision Tree AI for Word Game‑
Developed an entropy‑driven decision tree AI for a word game, achieving a
perfect 100% model accuracy rate.
• guessed words with an average of just 3.645 queries
• Employed entropy‑driven splitting and strategic stopping criteria, contributing to superior performance
•##XORRO PUF Response Predictor‑
Developed an innovative approach to decipher XORRO PUF (Physically Unclonable Function)
systems. Combined mathematical derivations and machine learning methods to tackle the prediction of individual PUF outputs
within XOR‑PUF systems.
